| Feature                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Geocoding                            | Convert addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), enabling applications to find locations or display addresses on maps.                                                                                                                     |
| Reverse Geocoding                    | Convert geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) into addresses, allowing applications to determine the location of a point on a map based on its coordinates.                                                                                                |
| Routing and Directions               | Provide reliable routing and direction services for different modes of transportation (e.g., driving, walking, public transit) with real-time traffic updates, helping users navigate from one location to another efficiently.                                    |
| Place Search and Recommendations    | Enable users to search for places of interest (e.g., restaurants, hotels, attractions) and receive personalized recommendations based on their preferences and current location, enhancing the discovery of nearby businesses and attractions.                        |
| Distance Matrix                     | Calculate travel distance and time for a matrix of origins and destinations, providing users with the ability to determine the best route for multiple locations and optimize travel plans.                                                                          |
